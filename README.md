# EigenCalc
Calculator wich will be used to calculate eigenvalues&amp;eigenvectors of a given matrix written in C++ using Eigen 3.3.7

The format: SolidID  \t  Eigenvalues seperated by spaces  \t  Eigenvectors seperated by spaces
Feel free to use/modify the code
You will need HyperWorks and Knowledge in TCL in order to use this Program in the intended way as this is a converter to calculate the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of solid moi in HyperWorks
